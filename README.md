This is going to be a strategic game, somewhat like Heroes.
I played this game before with a pencil, but it needs a rubber in that case it's much better to play this game on a computer

Rules:

So this game is played by two players. Each player has an army. The aim is to destroy the opponent's army.

Each turn a player can perform one action. He can put a new unit on the battle field or upgrade the exisiting one. There are different ways to upgrade units.
A player can declare war before his turn - in this case armies fight and the killed units are removed.

Each unit's strength variates in different directions according to its type. In fight unit damages enemies by the unit's strength number in relation to enemy. A unit doesn't damage units of the same army.

Each unit has a support ability depending on its direction. That means, if two nearby units have this ability towards each other they can spread their strength in this direction to some other directions. If support ability of a unit is at level 2, its strength number doubles.

Rotating and rearranging strength isn't considered as an action, a player can do that many times per turn.

A player can put new units only by the sides of the existing ones. In the begining each player has a command center that has support ability 1 in all directions and strength 1 in all directions.

Each unit has some health points. When in a battle a unit's number of health points becomes less than 1, this unit dies. All the damage is dealt instantly, no matter if the attacking unit dies that turn. After a combat all units recover and receive their default health points number.

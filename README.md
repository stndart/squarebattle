This is going to be a strategic game, somewhat like Heroes.
I played this game before, with pencil, but it needs rubber, so it's much better to play this on computer

Rules:

So this game is played by two players. Each player has an army. The aim is to destroy opponents' army.

Each turn player can perform one action. He can put a new unit on the battle field or upgrade the exisiting. There are some branches of upgrading units.
Before player's turn this player can declare war - in this case armies fight and killed units removed.

Each unit has different stregth in different directions. This depends on unit's type. In fight, unit deals damage enemies by unit's strength number in direction to enemy. Unit doesn't deal damage to units of the same army.

Each unit has support ability depending on direction. That means, if two nearby units have this ability towards each other they can spread their strength in this direction to some other directions. If support ability is at 2 level, this strength number doubles.

Rotating and rearranging strength doesn't count as an action, player can do that many times per turn.

Player can put new units only near existing one by side. In the begining each player has a command center that has support ability 1 in all directions and strength 1 in all directions.

Each unit has some health points. When in battle the number of health points necomes less than 1, it dies. All damage is dealt instantly, no matter if unit that deals damage will die that turn. After combat all units recover and receive their default health points number.
